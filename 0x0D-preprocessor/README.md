C Preprocessor This project is a deep dive into the use of macros in C [common predefined macros , how to include guard your header files] Some of the header files created include:

    A header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.
    A header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359. Also, C programs using macros to:
    print the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.
    compute the absolute value of a number using function-like macro.
    computes the sum of the numbers x and y using function-like macro.
